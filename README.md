The Dopamine Habit 

Hi, and thank you for being here. This app was created to allow you to keep track of your habits. Its main idea is also that you will be inspired by your current daily habits and choose some new ones. We believe that all humans have habits no matter what or how you judge these habits. If the choice in creating them is guided by your conscious mind and is result-driven, you're more likely to develop habits that support the life you're creating. 

So let's do this together, let us help! 

Start by creating an account. Go to the signup page so that you can enter a username and password as well as your email address. This will help us keep the information in your account where no one else can see. Next you'll be prompted to the login page, where you can enter your credentials to log yourself into your account. Next up, you'll see a list of "challenges" to get you going. Here you can use these to get inspired if you have no idea what you're into or what you want to do. Alternatively, you may have a pretty good idea of how you want to move forward and are ready to give the green light on some of these. By clicking the "turn this challenge into a habit" button, you'll be adding this particular challenge to your very own list of habits. Day after day when you open the app you click on which of those habits (as well as those you typed in yourself) you tended to on that particular day. 

After at least seven days, and ongoing of course, you will be able to run an analysis. Once you create an analysis you'll see a graph of how many days you devoted to each activity on your list, on that set of 7 days. Voila! Now you can see what you've been up to! 

We hope that this app will help you stay on track. Overtime, we hope that each habit will become second nature, just things you do! As you see your results on the page, we hope you enjoy that dopamine rush and keep coming back for more!
